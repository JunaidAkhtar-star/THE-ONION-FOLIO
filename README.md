## Adding Your Content  ✍️

# THE ONION FOLIO 🚀🧅

THE ONION FOLIO is my personal 3D animated portfolio — a place where clean code, AI experiments, and motion design all live together under a glowing purple sky.  
It’s built to feel like a tiny universe: fast-moving stars in the background, floating skill logos, and smooth transitions that guide you through my work. ✨

Whether you’re a recruiter, collaborator, or a curious developer, this site is designed to answer one question quickly:  
**“What can I build, and how do I think about building it?”** 💭

---

## What this portfolio showcases 💼

- My journey as a **Frontend Developer & AI Specialist**
- Real projects like **Rhythm Box**, **Chatbot Ticketing System**, **Cattle Vision AI**, and **The Onion Folio** itself
- A workflow-focused **approach section** that explains how I plan, design, and ship apps
- A clean, responsive, production-ready codebase you can explore or even fork as a starting point

If you enjoy modern UI, subtle 3D, and a mix of AI + frontend, you’ll feel right at home here. 😄
